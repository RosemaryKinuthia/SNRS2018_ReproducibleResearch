## Literate Programming > Dynamic Documentation > [R]Markdown

YEAR | Event
:----|:--------------------------------------------------------------
1992 | "Literate Programming" is introduced by Donald Knuth as "that (which) combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. **The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.**" [http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html)
2002 | Friedrich Leisch introduces `SWEAVE` a program for "Dynamic generation of statistical reports using literate data analysis" [https://leisch.userweb.mwn.de/Sweave/](https://leisch.userweb.mwn.de/Sweave/)

## Literate Programming > Dynamic Documentation > [R]Markdown

YEAR | Event
:----|:--------------------------------------------------------------
2004 | John Gruber created the `Markdown` language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz - their goal was to "write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)" [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2012 | Yihui Xie releases `knitr` R package released - `knitr` was inspired by `SWEAVE`
2014 | `rmarkdown` R package released - extends `Markdown` to work with R/RStudio environment

## The `WEB` System by Donald Knuth

The first published literate programming environment was `WEB`. Donald Knuth introduced it back in 1981 combining his TeX typesetting system with the Pascal programming language.

<img src="images/literateProg.PNG" alt="Literate Programming" style="width:430px;height:117px;">

<div class="quote-container2">

> _"I chose the name `WEB` partly because it was one of the few three-letter words of English that hadnâ€™t already been applied to computers. But as time went on, Iâ€™ve become extremely pleased with the name, because I think that a complex piece of software is, indeed, best **regarded as a web that has been delicately pieced together from simple materials**. ... If we **express a program as a web of ideas**, we can emphasize its structural properties in a natural and satisfying way."_<footnote>http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf</footnote>

</div>

## More Literate Programming Tools

Since WEB was introduced in 1981, many other programs implementing literate programming have emerged over time including:

* CWEB also created by Donald Knuth with Silvio Levy which was adapted for the C and C++ programming language instead of Pascal
* Axiom developed by IBM
* Noweb
* Literate
* Funnel WEB
* Molly 
* Codnar
* Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook)
* R Notebooks

## `SWEAVE` by Friedrich Leisch

<img src="images/sweave.PNG" alt="Sweave" style="width:598px;height:68px;">

<div class="quote-container2">

> What is Sweave?

> _"Sweave is a tool that allows to embed the R code for complete data analyses in latex documents. The purpose is to create dynamic reports, which can be updated automatically if data or analysis change. Instead of inserting a prefabricated graph or table into the report, the master document contains the R code necessary to obtain it. When run through R, all data analysis output (tables, graphs, etc.) is **created on the fly and inserted** into a final latex document. The report can be **automatically updated if data or analysis change, which allows for truly reproducible research**."_<footnote>Friedrich Leisch. Sweave: Dynamic generation of statistical reports using literate data analysis. In Wolfgang HÃ¤rdle and Bernd RÃ¶nz, editors, Compstat 2002 - Proceedings in Computational Statistics, pages 575-580. Physica Verlag, Heidelberg, 2002. ISBN 3-7908-1517-9.</footnote>

## The next evolution `<- knitr`

<div class="columns-2">

<div class="centered">
![](images/knitr.png) 
</div>

In 2012 Yihui Xie, created and released the `knitr` package for R to extend the capabilities of `SWEAVE` beyond LaTeX.

</div>

<div class="quote-container2">

> _"The **knitr** package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, solve some long-standing problems in Sweave, and combine features in other add-on packages into one package."_<footnote>[https://yihui.name/knitr/](https://yihui.name/knitr/)</footnote>

</div>

## The next evolution `<- ... + rmarkdown`

<div class="centered">
![](images/rmarkdown.png) 
</div>

* In 2014, RStudio released `rmarkdown` to extend the `markdown` language originally intended to write documents for the "web" _(i.e. HTML)_.<footnote>[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)</footnote> 

* `rmarkdown` leverages `Pandoc` _("universal document converter")_ <footnote>[http://pandoc.org/index.html](http://pandoc.org/index.html)</footnote> to convert between formats: from HTML (readable by web browsers) to DOC (such as from Microsoft Word or Google Docs) to ODT (Libre Office) to PDF (portable document format) to others like EPUB (e-books), HTML5 slide shows (slidy, ioslides), and TeX based documents and slides (Beamer).

## 10 Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research<footnote>Sandve, G.K.; Nekrutenko, A.; Taylor, J.; Hovig, E. (2013) "Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research" PLOS Computational Biology, 9(10).[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)</footnote>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><div class="columns-1">

1. For every result, keep track of how it was produced
2. Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps
3. Archive the Exact Version of All External Programs Used
4. Version Control All Custom Scripts
5. Record All Intermediate Results, When POssible in Standardized Formats
6. For Analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds
7. Always Store Raw Data Behind Plots
8. Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to be Inspected
9. Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results
10. Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results

</span></div>

## Standard Practices

_Think about your own work..._

* What do you want to automate?
* What could you re-use?
    - code, files, formatting, graphics, logos, header, footer, boilerplate
* What should you share with your team?
* What do you find yourself doing over and over?
    - correcting or reformatting
* If you won the lottery today (and left your job), what do you need to tell your replacement so they can pick up where you left off and complete your current tasks?

## Journalism - 538.com

538.com [http://fivethirtyeight.com/](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) hosts stories and opinion pieces covering poll analyses, politics, economics, health, popular culture, and sports. The founder, Nate Silver, and the 538 team are best known for their political polling and forecasting during the United States Presidential and related elections since 2008. ESPN now owns 538.com (as of 2013) retaining Nate Silver as the Editor-in-Chief.

Most of their articles provide references and links to the original data sources plus details on how their figures, analyses and statistical models were developed. They also host the data, code and details behind their analyses on Github [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/).

We will work with some of these datasets in our exercises later in this course and work with the `fivethirtyeight` R package [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/).

## Telling Stories with Data

Andrew Flowers (economist, data scientist, journalist and former writer for fivethirtyeight.com) presented "Finding and Telling Stories with R" at the 2017 RStudio Conference (Orlando, FL).

The webinar recording of his presentation is available online  [https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/finding-and-telling-stories-with-r/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/finding-and-telling-stories-with-r/). 

In his presentation, he highlights the various aspects of "data journalism" and importance of workflow, data processing and transparency in analysis and communication - all key aspects of reproducibility. Andrew Flowers is also a contributor to the `fivethirtyeight` R package.

## **Transparency** - Journal of Biostatsatistics

"Our reproducible research policy is for papers in the journal to be kite-marked **D** if the data on which they are based are freely available, **C** if the authorsâ€™ code is freely available, and **R** if both data and code are available, and our Associate Editor for Reproducibility is able to use these to reproduce the results in the paper. Data and code are published electronically on the journalâ€™s website as Supplementary Materials."

[https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/pages/General_Instructions](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/pages/General_Instructions)

Example of an article marked **R**:

* Air pollution and health in Scotland: a multicity study; by 
Duncan Lee; Claire Ferguson ; and Richard Mitchell; 
Biostatistics, Volume 10, Issue 3, 1 July 2009, Pages 409â€“423, [https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp010](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp010) 

## Speed - 2001 outbreak of _E.Coli 0104:H4_

In 2001 there was an outbreak of _E.Coli 0104:H4_ that killed 50 people in Europe [http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100001](http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100001).

Researchers at BGI _(formally the Beijing Genomics Institute)_ worked in collaboration with the Medical Center in Hamburg-Eppendorf to rapidly sequence the genome of the pathogen. Given the severity of the outbreak, the team announced and released the genome via Twitter to the world-wide community of microbial genomicists. 

A Github repository was established [https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki](https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki) to "crowdsource" analysis and research to find a treatment.

People started contributing their work in under **24 HOURS** and within **5 DAYS!!** a bacterial agent was proposed to kill the pathogen. _**This case, highlights the importance of these methods and work practices not only for speed and efficiency but also in rapidly addressing problems and developing solutions that can save lives.**_

## Documentation

* main component is text
* well written
* good organization and flow
* easily accessible
* understood by team members at all levels
* code + text + figures combined [e.g. literate programming]
* at end, formatting styles applied via "markup/markdown"

## Organization

* projects grow
* supporting documentation and files - numerous
* relationships change and can grow more complex
* need file organization and naming schemes
* file names should be:
    - readable by the computer, easy to search, easy to sort (especially by date and author if needed)
    - human readable with logical naming schemes and contain enough info so human knows what is in the file/what the file is for
    - and short enough to be reasonably manageable
* consider user-based access and security (partitioned by "need to know" _[users with editing and write permissions versus users with read-only access]_

Research Compendium Example [https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg)

## Automation

* at a minimum, a diagram or instructions for workflow should be documented on how the components are to be assembled for your final product
* write code/scripts to automate
    - data raw to processed output
    - creating and removing temporary files
    - creating tables, figures, other components
    - assembling the components into final documents, products
    - rendering documents into multiple/desired formats
    
## Dissemination - Why?

* store and share your data and code â€“ even if it is only for your future reference
* sometimes expectation/requirement of funding agency, publisher
* increased visibility, you as source - default subject matter expert
* speed of collaboration - faster advancement of science, knowledge
* good will with community/public
